# Yirui's Project---Accounting Software

## Introduction

### What will the application do?

- The application is about an easy version of **accounting software**. It allows the users to keep track of their 
expenses and have a basic idea of their *monthly expenditure*. It will also support *various currencies* so that it is
possible for the users to spend different currencies and keep accounts.

### Who will use it?

- According to the feature, **international students** or **people who need to deal with transnational payments** are 
the primary audiences. Sometimes, if people get financial supports by families or by themselves, they do not want to 
exceed budgets, so the monthly summarizing graph will give a compact result of the expenditures, and they can reflect 
based on that.


### Why is this project of interest to me?

- As an international student, I always have a budget on the monthly and yearly expenses. I feel like spending money 
wisely, so I need some **statistical analysis** to help me understand my spending. Plus, for most of the time, I need to 
deal with money with *different exchange rates*. It could be the money that I use in my home country and also Canadian 
dollars. So I would like to have an application that is convenient to transfer the different exchange rates when I do
bookkeeping.
